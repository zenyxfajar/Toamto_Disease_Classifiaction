# Tomato_Disease_Classification
Here's my notebook while practicing building a machine learning model using tensorflow. 

I build a machine learning model that able to classify between tomato plant disease and also the healthy

The model is build using CNN with dataset downloaded from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf

In this notebook the model validation accuracy is around 93%. I used the picture from the dataset validation folder and the model succesfully guess the picture class and get 23% confidence 

i plan to continue working on this and convert it into tf lite model
